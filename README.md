# ExportToArchive

A plugin for iPhoto to export selected photos to .zip, .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 formats. 

*Note* I have not used this in a long time, and I don't know if it will work with versions
of iPhoto newer than iPhoto 6.0. Use at your own risk.

## Building

You will need to build this using Xcode.
